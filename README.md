# bh-lens-observations
Observational dataset of BH-type object counts near selected strong gravitational lenses. SIMBAD-based queries were performed at multiple radii (10′, 15′, 20′), with results including fields showing zero detections. Useful for validating clustering signals and comparison with random fields.
